# Bike-share-Analysis
This project is based on the Google Data Analytics Course.

The [Dataset](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) I used is from Jan, 2024 to Dec, 2024.

The Task for this project is to find the differences from Member and Casual customers to convert casual riders into annual members. 

Based on the dataset we can get those two images.

We can draw the following conclusions:
* The average usage time of casual riders is longer than that of member riders
* The number of casual riders and the duration of bike rides increase significantly on weekends
* The average ride duration of member rides has no direct relationship between the day of week, but the number of member rides on weekends is less than on weekdays.

# Potential conclusion:

***Members tend to commute short distances**

The average riding time of members is shorter, which means they are more likely to use it for commuting and short trips, such as from the subway station to the company.
Their high frequency of use may be because cycling is part of their daily travel.

***Non-members are more likely to be tourists or occasional users**

Non-members ride longer, which means they may use it for leisure, sightseeing, and weekend trips.
They ride less frequently, probably because the single payment is not cost-effective, but they lack the motivation to become members.

***Membership plans are for frequent users**

Members may pay for a monthly or annual membership, so they ride more frequently, even for short distances.
Non-members may pay by the minute for each ride, so they may try to ride longer at a time to get the most value for money.

# Recommend:

**Provide "free trial"**

Let non-members experience the membership service for 3-7 days and feel the convenience of membership.
For example, "first month membership is only 5 yuan" to lower the threshold for trial.

**Launch "stored value card" or "time package"**

Non-members may not want to subscribe for a long time, but you can launch a "10-time ride card" to get them used to it.
Once they use it frequently, they may consider becoming a formal member.

**Optimize pricing model**

If non-members ride for a long time, it may be because they think short-distance rides are too expensive.
For example: adjust short-distance pricing (free for the first 10 minutes, and charged after that) to encourage short-distance users to become members.
